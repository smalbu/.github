# Future Stack

In 5 years, no company will rent software. It will be convenient, cheap, and secure to define, build, and operate your own products.

SaaS will be dead. Engineering teams will dissolve. Employees will build the tools they need themselves.

This shift started with low code and database tools. It's accelerating with AI app builders.

But gaps remain—especially in security, infrastructure, and decision-making in professional contexts. Employees will need a safe foundation to build up on, a reliable stack.

A future stack.

Our mission: Build a software and hardware stack that empowers people to create products that are reliable, intuitive, and compliant.

The stack will be industry-agnostic. Yet we'll start in two areas: small business operating software and project-management software in regulated industries like health, defense, or aerospace.

This contrasting positioning will rapidly test our assumptions. Each area gets its own brand. The core stack remains the same.
